It is most commonly known as Pig Game. The total score for one player to win is 100. 
Firstly, the player 1, who starts, rolls a dice randomly. If it gets a 1, all the accumulated score before is lost. 
To prevent that, the player must press the button hold, in order to secure the score.
Finally, there is the new game button, which resets the entire game.
